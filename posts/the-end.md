# The end

Now that I already cover the core port of `OpenBSD`'s `netcat ` implementation, it is time to wrap up this little book now (Definitely, there are parts I leave out, e.g., using `netcat` behind proxy.). The following material can be referred if someone wants to dig more into `netcat`:    

(1) [netcat manual](https://man.openbsd.org/nc.1);  
(2) [netcat source code](https://github.com/openbsd/src/tree/master/usr.bin/nc);  
(3) A [project](https://github.com/NanXiao/netcat) which extracts `netcat` source code and can be built and run on `OpenBSD`.  

If this little book gives you a help, there are  `2` methods you can express gratitude:  
(1) Free - give this project a star on [github](https://github.com/NanXiao/openbsd-netcat-demystified);  
(2) Non-free - Donate to [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsdfoundation.org/campaign2018.html).  

If you think this tutorial is totally a crap, anyway, I admit it ......

Happy network hacking! Bye!
